# myip
Simple tool to check IP address of request, ready to just upload into a webserver that supports PHP. Available at https://myip.wreeper.top/
# How to use it?
This isn't rocket science. The simplest way to use it is from the index. (first option)

All you have to do is to send a GET request a.k.a just visit the URL in your browser.

https://myip.wreeper.top/ -> will return the ip address in plain text response

https://myip.wreeper.top/json/ -> will return the ip address in JSON response (for those who want it)

https://myip.wreeper.top/javascript/ -> will return the ip address in a JavaScript variable (useful for client-side websites, maybe?)
